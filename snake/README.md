# Snake Frontend Interview Question

This question is aimed at entry level front end web developer roles.

## Scenario

Interviewer plays the role of Product Manager. PM has a vision of building the
next hot new game: snake! Interviewer explains to candidate that a dev started
to implement the game, but is out sick, so now candidate has to take over the
code (provided by interviewer).

## What to Look for

This question is intended to gauge how well a candidate is able to work with an
existing codebase under potentially shifting product requirements. It also
allows the interviewer to gauge how proficient the candidate is with
JS/CSS/HTML.

## Additional Notes

Interviewer should ask candidate to gradually add new features to the game,
so as not to overwhelm the candidate. Some example features are:

* Implementing pause functionality
* Implementing boundary detection with a game over display
* Displaying a score
* Alternating the color of the snake/background/etc

Use of Google is allowed, and it is strongly encouraged that the interviewer
works together with candidate almost as if pair programming.
